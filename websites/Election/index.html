                Leody de Guzman, 61, is an activist and labor leader who has pushed for policies to secure the rights and welfare of workers since 1984.
                He ran for senator in 2019 under the tagline "Manggagawa Naman" but failed to secure a seat. He currently sits as chairperson of the
                Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, a socialist labor center and federation of militant trade unions.<br>
                He is running under the opposition coalition Laban ng Masa on a progressive and worker-centric platform hinged on a complete reform 
                of the country’s political system to foster social development and eventually augment the economy.<br>
                De Guzman has vowed to challenge the interests of the rich by increasing taxes for billionaires, decreeing minimum wage, and banning 
                contractualization, among others. He has also said he would halve the size of the national police and military and surrender enforcers
                and key figures in the current administration’s war on drugs.<br>

            <dd>
                Francisco "Isko Moreno" Domagoso is the incumbent mayor of the City of Manila. After serving as the capital city's vice mayor from
                2007 to 2016, he ran for senator but failed to secure a seat. He was then appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as chairman of the board
                of the North Luzon Railways Corporation and later, undersecretary at the Department of Social Welfare and Development.<br>
                Since taking office, Domagoso has focused on improving public health and school facilities and providing low-cost housing for the urban poor,
                along with beautification and tourism projects across the city. Most recently, he has spearheaded Manila's pandemic response which
                includes mitigation, vaccination, and assistance programs along with giving out free medicine and testing services even for non-residents
                of the city.<br>
                Similar to Duterte in 2016, Moreno is campaigning on a platform of "duplicating" his local projects on a national level.
                These projects include socialized housing, modernized public school education and continuing the administration's anti-drug campaign.<br>

            <dd>
                Norberto B. Gonzales, 74, is an avowed democratic-socialist, whose long career spans activism and union organizing, 
                peace talks negotiation and national security adviser, defense secretary and presidential chief of staff appointments under the 
                Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration. He chairs the Philip­pine Democratic Socialist Party, which has roots in the protest movement 
                in the 1970s and participated in the mass campaigns against the Marcos dictatorship, peace talks with the Moro National Liberation 
                Front and the ouster of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada.<br>
                During his tenure in the Arroyo administration, Gonzales was involved in the Venable contract controversy, concerning the eventually 
                cancelled agreement with a United States-based consultancy firm engaged by Gonzales allegedly on behalf of Arroyo to manage the president’s 
                charter change plans. Critics assailed the contract for seeking US funding for efforts to shift the Philippines to a parliamentary system,
                a violation of Philippine sovereignty, and the exorbitant $900,000 or P50.4 million contract price. The Senate blue ribbon committee later
                recommended the filing of charges against Gonzales for entering into the “illegal” contract and doing so without authority. However, 
                no such charges were filed.<br>
                He was also among the heads of Oplan Bantay Laya, a wide-scale counter-insurgency program of the government, which received much criticism
                for alleged legal and human rights violations such as extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances and illegal detention by political
                activists as well as independent fact-finding bodies led by former Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo and United Nations special rapporteur for
                human rights Philip Alston.<br>
                Later, Gonzales became part of the National Transformation Council, a group of Arroyo allies among former government officials,
                politicians and catholic clergy that called for President Benigno Aquino III to resign and be replaced by an interim government.
                The group denied accusations that it was instigating a coup d’ etat against Aquino.<br>
                As a surprise candidate for the 2022 presidential election, Gonzales frames many of the issues faced by the country as matters of national
                security, including food security and the COVID-19 pandemic. He vows to prioritize reform of the agricultural sector to boost food production
                and increase farmers’ income.<br>

                third term in the Senate.<br>
                Lacson has authored laws such as the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, the Philippine Identification System Act of 2018,
                and the Reproductive Health Act of 2011. He has long served as a watchdog on the national budget, pushing to delete pork barrel
                and other questionable insertions during plenary Senate debates.<br>
                Prior to becoming a lawmaker, he served as chief of the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001. He started his career in law
                enforcement in 1971 as a member of the infamous Metrocom Intelligence Security Group that was responsible for the disappearances and
                torture of activists and critics of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Lacson denies that he ever took part in the MISG's nefarious
                activities, maintaining that he worked on cases involving kidnap for ransom, holdups, and common crimes as a member of the 
                unit's police branch.<br>
                He also launched a failed bid for the presidency in 2004.<br>
                If elected, Lacson vows to restore public trust in government by improving the country’s pandemic response, purging the bureaucracy
                of corrupt officials, and allowing local governments more autonomy.<br>

                Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., 64, son and namesake of the late ousted dictator, was elected unopposed into vice gubernatorial seats
                in Ilocos Norte at the height of his father’s regime in 1980, and eventually into congressional seats representing the same province after
                his family’s return to the Philippines in 1991. He also served as a senator from 2010 to 2016 before losing a bid for higher office to
                Vice President Leni Robredo in the 2016 elections.<br>
                In at least three civil cases involving the successful recovery of the Marcos family’s ill-gotten wealth, Marcos Jr. is impleaded as a
                defendant. The Presidential Commission on Good Government, the quasi-judicial agency tasked with recovering ill-gotten wealth accumulated
                by the Marcos family and its associates, has so far reclaimed P174.2 billion as of March 2021 — some of which went to compensating victims
                of human rights abuse during the Martial Law era. Another P125.9 billion has yet to be recovered and remains under litigation.<br>
                The commission has said that the younger Marcos barred government attempts to take back the money stolen by his family, though Marcos
                claims that he never possessed or even benefitted from ill-gotten wealth.<br>

                to the presidential race and his first campaign for public office.<br>
                His tandem with Rizalito David is basing its platform on what the candidates call a faith-based approach to glorify God. Montemayor
                has expressed his opposition to same-sex unions, abortion (except for medical reasons), divorce and the death penalty.<br>
                He is campaigning on a 10-point agenda to address COVID-19, eliminate corruption, improve the campaign against illegal drugs,
                achieve full employment, alleviate poverty and attain economic prosperity. His agenda also includes a holistic approach to the West
                Philippine Sea, the welfare of migrant Filipinos, press freedom, education, negotiations with rebel groups and advancements in agriculture
                and infrastructure.<br>
                Although he vows to address the pandemic, Montemayor has made harmful claims about COVID-19 and the tools employed to mitigate its spread.
                He incorrectly claimed at his campaign kickoff that both RT-PCR tests and antigen tests are useless and inaccurate.<br>
                The same event was marked by the non-compliance of some attendees and Montemayor himself with the pandemic

                Manny Pacquiao is a Philippine legislator who has served in both chambers of Congress since 2010. He first gained acclaim as a world-class
                champion boxer and juggled his careers as a public official and athlete until 2021 when he announced his retirement from the sport.
                The boxer-turned-legislator is also a preacher and founded the church Word for Everyone Ministries International, Inc. in 2012.<br>
                Pacquiao has consistently been noted for being the top absentee among lawmakers and for penning a relatively low number of laws and bills.
                He principally authored the National Bible Day Act and the Handbook for OFWs Act of 2017.<br>
                Citing his religious beliefs as a born-again Christian, Pacquiao has expressed support for the LGBTQ community but not same-sex marriage.
                In 2016, he drew ire both locally and internationally for derogatory remarks he made about the minority group.<br>
                He previously supported the reinstatement of the death penalty for the manufacturing and trafficking of illegal drugs but,
                like other candidates seeking higher office, reversed his position in Nov. 2021.<br>
                Pacquiao is campaigning on ridding the country of corruption, criminality, and poverty, though he has not published any concrete
                policy proposals as of this writing.<br>
                He has said that religious leaders, especially from evangelical groups, will be part of his Cabinet and anti-corruption task force if elected.<br>

                Leni Robredo, 56, is currently serving as the 14th vice president of the Philippines. Her office has garnered the highest audit rating
                from the Commission on Audit for three consecutive years (2018-2020) and has been recognized by Malacañang for its pandemic
                response programs across the country.<br>
                Her flagship program as vice president, Angat Buhay, is an anti-poverty program providing and coordinating support through
                multiple advocacy areas, namely food security and nutrition, healthcare, public education, rural development, housing, and
                resettlement and women empowerment. The Angat Buhay Program has mobilized at least P520 million worth of resources for the
                benefit of 321,000 families and 223 communities nationwide, according to the latest updates as of this writing.<br>
                Robredo has also led numerous relief operations through the Office of the Vice President. The same office manages a comprehensive
                COVID-19 response program that offers a range of assistance projects such as free transportation services to frontliners,
                free teleconsultation services nationwide, handling logistics and manpower to transmit vaccine supply from the national government
                task force to local government units and vaccine express sites in partnership with LGUs.<br>
                She first entered public office as representative of Camarines Sur’s third congressional district in 2013, less than a year after the
                death of her husband, then-Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo. Prior to this, Robredo worked as a lawyer with a focus on legal developmental
                work and providing legal assistance to marginalized clients.<br>
                In her lone term in the House of Representatives, Robredo principally authored three bills that were signed into law, including
                the Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act.<br>
                If elected, Robredo says she will spend her first 100 days in office strengthening the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.<br>
